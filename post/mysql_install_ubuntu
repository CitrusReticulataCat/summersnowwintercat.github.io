## MySQL 8.0 Installation ( Ubuntu )

> 1. APTアップデートとMySQLのインストールを行う
```
# update ubuntu
sudo apt-get update & upgrade
# install mysql package
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
# mysql installation
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
> 2.  SetUp VALIDATE PASSWORD
```
Securing the MySQL server deployment.
Connecting to MySQL using a blank password.
VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?
Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: Y
// enter = Y
```
> 3. Levels of password validation policy
```
There are three levels of password validation policy:
LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary file
Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 1
// password level = 1
```
> 4. Set the password for Root
```
Please set the password for root here.
New password: <password>
Re-enter new password: <password>
Estimated strength of the password: 50 
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
// enter = Y
```
> 5. Remove anonymous users
```
By default, a MySQL installation has an anonymous user,
allowing anyone to log into MySQL without having to have
a user account created for them. This is intended only for
testing, and to make the installation go a bit smoother.
You should remove them before moving into a production
environment.
Remove anonymous users? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
// enter = Y
```
> 6. Disallow root login remotely
```
Normally, root should only be allowed to connect from
'localhost'. This ensures that someone cannot guess at
the root password from the network.
Disallow root login remotely? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :  Y
// enter = Y
```
> 7. Remove test database and access to it
```
By default, MySQL comes with a database named 'test' that
anyone can access. This is also intended only for testing,
and should be removed before moving into a production
environment.
Remove test database and access to it? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : Y
// enter  = Y
```
> 8. Reload privilege tables
```
Reloading the privilege tables will ensure that all changes
made so far will take effect immediately.
Reload privilege tables now? (Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) :  Y
// enter  = Y
```

# check user and auth
mysql> SELECT user,authentication_string,plugin,host FROM mysql.user;
```

# get user privileges
